# Euclidean-Algorithm

The Euclidean algorithm, also called Euclid's algorithm, is an algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers a and b, the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid.

# Given integers a and b find d
where d is the gcd of a and b
# d = gcd(a,b)

It is used in countless applications, including computing and attacking the RSA cryptosystem.
